==========

A basic NN library for Python 3

Features:

- Arbitrary number of layers with arbitrary number of neurons
- Various activation functions (sigmoid, relu, tanh, linear)
- Gradient checking \o/
- Multiclass classification problems (cross entropy loss)
- Batch learning
- Regularization (2-norm)
- 'He' Initialization (works well with relu layers)


TODO:

- Dropout?
